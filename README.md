# sudoku-rs
This repo holds a small rust program to solve sudoku puzzles.

It is intended to use high-level idiomatic rust.

Currently I have implemented the following solving algorithms:

- recursive backtracking

I plan to add the following algorithms if I can:
- Stochastic search via simulated annealing
- Exact cover via Knuth's Algorithm X
